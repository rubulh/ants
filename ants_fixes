1.get_the_id()-that get_the_id_takes two parameters but i am yet to fix the second one asi am not sure about the nature of the facebook thing-so all i have to do is that wherever i find the get_the id finction later oi ahev to edit the parameters appropiately
2.i have set variables like $a=;as i was not sure of the variables available so need to correct that also
3.the declaration of the status string for the user is something like this 0(abc,cde,fgh,ijk,lmn){anh,bhc,oty,000}
4.the open_stacks_counter will note < @abc >-(@:draw)(a:storage1)(b:storage2)(c:storage3);--if stack two is empty for eg-< @a00 >
5.places where i have to decide yet
	@)draw-how to get the game id

6.card stack is somewhat like that in the allglobals file
	i imlode it in form of an string separated by ',' and append two zeros at the start of the game
	first 0 for R
	second zero for the slot as a '`'


7.not yet decided whether to pass and what to pass in the draw from sloyt and the draw form draw function::decide it later


8.the flow should be something like 
   as soon as turn leads to an user
	set open slots
		if draw open--draw card on mouseclick
			--priority tells what type of card is that
				--if of other suit only discard pile opened by open piles
				--otherwise appropiate piles opened in caes of appropiate piles opened	on attempt to o-pen the particular pile
					--the corresspoending pile function is called to store in the pile 				
					--in case of storing at the draw pile a function called so as to check for completetion


9. in the file card_in_slot_inspection i have top get the game hash in order for the open stacks thing to run---later on i might remove this variable pass from the open stacks so that it becomes easier for the other scripts to call it:i have done that all i need to do is to check the open_stack function declaration everywhere

10. moreover i have to add the fourth stack thing i need to edit these files

11.i hve to edit the decide the nature of field key in the cars_in_others_colony_inspection and other inspection files
		it might be that the other ffile s dont require filed key as well
		BUT CURRENTLY I HAVE SET THE FIELD KEY AS THE STATUS1 OR STATUS2

		CONSIDER IF THAT NEED fiedkey CHANGING i need to change other things such as the blocak for inverting the field key in the same script


12.also i have not copleted the card inspection from discard script which ;ll be required	at the time of trading as it is special,event

13.moreover the draw from draw has to take care of the attack mode


14.the status string the place_cardscript must be a status1 or status2

15.the select_stack:
	decide the exeption that some number other than 1 is passed im the permission 
	get the id
	decide th exception that the id fetched using  the get the idd script is not being reflected in the databse query neither in id 1 or id 2;;
	regex script to extract the colony and script cards out of the status string not in place
	nor the last card card extraction has been fixed




16.STILL TO DECIDE WHETHJER THE PRIORITY STRING IS SUFFICIENT OR STILL I ANEED TO APPEND A 'a' AT THE BEGINNING


17.in the main player 1 the get_the_id function need s to be inspected;;
the user status string and the the last card and the the slots have not been availed
 


18. i have added two fields to the tabel allgame s tabel but to get the functionlity of the two fields	 they must be updated by trhe corresspponding scripts which has not bee updated;; i need to add those ::::::::::::::

19.also the draw key has to be set as 0 or 1 or else trthe attack generates an error:also the parameter is called the requiured colony card--but it s actually the



20 the draw_avail has to be without any startup strings ie its has got to be plain eg::::abc,def,ghi,jkl

21.the attackmacan be used to see future attacks to u asa well as to see furher attacks you may inflict

the parameter list is
gamehash-rank-idoftheuser to be checked-keynumber-one or zero
for trackking that of an opponet-might attack -ppassone or zero
for seeing if u can attack pass 0



22.the resurrection script will return the type of resurrection fetched against each type of attack ;;

parameter list gamehash--user_id(who will try to defend)--the rank against which resurrection required--the key-numnber of the user who is trying to defend--0  or 1;;
0 for only top card drawn from the draw and placed into colony of the paseed user;the second card from draw drawn and placed on my pile to attack;;;;the third card decides the REINFORMENT



>>>>>fb_id in the table_allusers refers to the facebook id;
	user_id is the id of the _user in the table which is an auto increment primary key
>>>>> a  function called get_the_rating($the_fb_id)
	to calculate the rating of the current user which ll be userful in matching;
